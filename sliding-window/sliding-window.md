# Slicing window

## What is a slicing window approach?

An algorithm approach to solve problems with secuences by mantaining a moving "window" and performing operations as the window moves through the iterable

## When to use?

- problem includes secuences (strings, arrays, linked lists)
- problem asks to find maximum or smallest subarray

## Steps

1. Determine the window size: Is the window size fixed or variable? If it is variable in which conditions does it change?
2. Intitialized and process: perform any operations within the initial window (especially if the window is fixed)
3. Update and evaluate: adjust evaluations or computations based on the new window element
4. Slide: continue sliding the window until the end of the sequence
5. Result: return result
